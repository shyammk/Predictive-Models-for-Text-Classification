Video technology will not make football a mistake-free sport
Competitive English football finally enters the brave new world of video technology on Monday night, with the head of professional referees warning it will not make the game “100 per cent perfect”.
As exclusively revealed by The Daily Telegraph last month, Monday evening’s FA Cup third-round tie between Brighton and Hove Albion and Crystal Palace will stage the first live trial of so-called Video Assistant Referees in this country with a view to rolling them out throughout the top end of the game next season.
The experiment will be the first of two inside three days, with Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg between Chelsea and Arsenal also selected for what will be at least a dozen such tests before the end of the campaign.
The introduction of VAR has the potential to revolutionise the way the game is officiated but the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, Mike Riley, said the “biggest challenge” with the technology would be educating players, managers and fans that it is neither a panacea for controversial calls nor will it “sanitise” a sport in which debatable decisions are a key part.

Intercom Are Doubling Their Product Teams In SF, Dublin & London
Six years ago, Intercom invented business messaging – helping internet businesses interact with their customers in a personal, scalable way that had never been done before and becoming one of the Irish startup success stories.
Today, 500 million business conversations happen each month through Intercom, and that number is doubling year-over-year. A major reason why is because Intercom’s customers have found that when they use Intercom to talk to their website visitors, conversion rates and sales increase by more than 80%.
Being laser focused on driving breakthrough innovations helps their customers grow their businesses efficiently. Over the past year, intercom have introduced new products, like their bot Operator and their live chat solution for sales and marketing teams, along with new levels of automation and intelligence to help do this.
As Intercom are introducing new products they are also doubling the size of the Product teams at Intercom over the next 18 months, specifically in the areas of engineering, design, product management, research and analytics. The 350 people being hired will be spread across their offices in San Francisco, Dublin, London, Chicago and Sydney.

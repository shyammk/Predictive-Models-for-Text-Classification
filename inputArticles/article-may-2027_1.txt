Apple Inc. Phone Pricing Likely To Trend Lower
There has been a ton of speculation about which direction Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will go with pricing for its next generation phones after having limited success with the iPhone X, which checked in with an eye-popping price tag. We can add RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani in the camp of those that believe the tech giant will head a bit south on the price chart for the next round of phones.
RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani discussed pricing on Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) next-generation iPhone launches, expected in the September time-frame. Daryanani expects Apple to introduce three new phones: an update to the current 5.8″ iPhone X (iPhone XI?), a larger 6.5″ OLED device (iPhone XI Plus?) and a budget-friendly 6.1″ LCD iPhone (iPhone 9?).
Dayanani expects the LCD model to be priced at $700+ while also accounting for between 35 and 50 percent of sales volume of the upcoming releases. He pegs the smaller OLED phone at $899, while estimating the larger OLED model to come in at a price point of $999. Last year’s iPhone X checked in with an average price of around $1,000.
RBC maintains its outperform rating for Apple while sticking to its price target of $205.

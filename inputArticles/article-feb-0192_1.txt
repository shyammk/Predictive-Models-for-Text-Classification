Chinese billionaire targets Manchester United shares in new deal, reports suggest
A MYSTERY Chinese investor is thought to be interested in purchasing a stake in Manchester United, according to reports. A group is working on behalf of an unnamed billionaire Asian buyer to judge the potential interest of various independent shareholders in selling up, according to reports.
The club is listed on the New York stock exchange and the negotiators want to secure something in the region of an eight per cent stake.
There have been persistent rumours that some members of the Glazer family – who control some 80 per cent of the club – are ready to relinquish a large chunk of shares. The six children of the late Malcolm Glazer, who purchased the club for £790million in 2005, reportedly hold differing views on whether to sell their shares. The takeover was controversial because the Florida based businessman had to borrow £525million, which the club was then burdened with. Since then, they have spent an estimated £1billion servicing that debt.
In June, Manchester United was hailed as the world’s most valuable football club by Forbes magazine.
Football clubs continue to be attractive trophy assets for billionaires around the world with Chinese buyers recently acquiring a host of English clubs.

Owning a sports club is way too expensive for most people, but if you still want to get a piece of the pie, try investing in these sports stocks. It may seem like these companies are swimming in money because professional athletes get multi-million dollar contracts and sports teams boast ridiculous valuations. But the reality is that just like any other company, the equipment makers, broadcasters and sponsors of professional sports face fierce competition. Here are some tips to keep in mind when investing in sport stocks:
Use your head
Sports fans can be a bit biased when it comes to evaluating the strength of a player or team. Just because a company is affiliated with your favourite player or team does not necessarily mean it's a good investment. Doing research and making sure the company has good fundamentals is essential.
Know the season
Some sports are played year-round, but are only popular at certain times of the year. Getting to know the schedule, especially when the playoffs take place can give you a leg up on the competition. Contrarily, the off-season might be a good time to buy depending on sponsorship deals or player events.
Build your playbook
In sports, some plays succeed and others just don’t work out. Coaches create multiple plays to mitigate this risk and increase their chances of victory by not putting all their eggs in one basket. Investing works the same way. By diversifying your portfolio, if one of your stocks has a bad quarter you won’t go belly-up.
